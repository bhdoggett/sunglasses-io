This project demonstrates skills in backend api construction as well as testing with mocha, using the chai (including chai-http) library.

No front-end code is provided, but the api docs can be viewed via Swagger UI after starting the server.

To start the server, type 'node app/server.js' from the project directory. You can now view the api docs via Swagger UI at http://localhost:3000/api-docs/

To run tests, stop the server and type 'mocha test/server.test.js' in the terminal from the project directory. All api routes are tested for valid and invalid requests of varying kinds.
